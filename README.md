# Lightweight-HTTP-Server-Using-Python-Sockets
This project aims to develop a simple HTTP server using Pythonâ€™s socket module. The server will listen for incoming HTTP requests, parse them, and respond with static HTML content. Unlike full-fledged web servers like Apache or Nginx, this lightweight server is designed for educational purposes and basic web serving functionalities.
